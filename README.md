### Hi there 👋, I'm Srinidh Vudityala

I'm a senior AI/ML Engineer with over 10 years of experience architecting, building, and deploying production-grade AI solutions. I'm a hands-on engineer who turns complex research (like Agentic AI and RAG) into reliable, high-performance applications.

I have a passion for mentoring and teaching students get into AI Space by introducing them to Beginner ML Workflows and problems. 

🔍 Core Expertise: Architecting multimodal models (PyTorch/TensorFlow), deploying MLOps pipelines (Kubernetes/MLflow), and fine-tuning LLMs (QLoRA).

🤖 Domain Focus: Building high-stakes AI for FinTech (fraud, risk) and other high-compliance environments.

📊 Production Experience: My work at Discover and American Express involved building real-time fraud detection systems, architecting agentic RAG platforms, and deploying services that handle millions of daily inferences.

🔧 Tools of the Trade: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangGraph, CrewAI, RAG, Kubernetes, Databricks, Spark, Kafka, AWS, Azure, and more.

Let's connect and build.

I'm currently open to senior-level, hands-on contract (C2C) opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you're tackling an interesting engineering challenge.
